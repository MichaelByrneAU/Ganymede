A physically-based rendering library implemented in Rust, using principles and techniques outlined in [PBRT](http://www.pbrt.org/ "PBRT"). 

# Background
This is primarily a personal learning exercise. As of starting this project I know approximately nothing about computer rendering and only slightly more about Rust. By tackling something like this, my hope is to:
- improve my ability to reason with the design of large systems and libraries
- gain experience in writing effective documentation
- become a better all-round engineer

I apoligise if things could be implemented in a more effective or idiomatic way, I'm always open to any feedback!

# Similar Projects
Other developers have designed similar systems, here are a few:
- [tray_rust](https://github.com/TwinkleBear/tray_rust "tray_rust")
- [Rustracer](https://bitbucket.org/abusch/rustracer/src/master/ "Rustracer")
- [rs_pbrt](https://github.com/wahn/rs_pbrt "rs_pbrt")
