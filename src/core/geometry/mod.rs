//! Geometric primitives and associated operations.
//!
//! This module contains implementations for points, vectors, surface normals,
//! rays and bounding boxes. These basic geometric constructions are used
//! across the entire rendering system. It should be noted that for
//! three-dimensional operations, Ganymede uses a *left-handed* coordinate
//! system.
